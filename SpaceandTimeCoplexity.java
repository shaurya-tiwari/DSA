// TIME COMPLEXITY - Relation between input size and running time operation .

// BEST CASE-omega(1) 
    // Best case time complexity is O(1) when the algorithm performs a constant amount of time regardless of the input size.
    // Examples:
    //  - Accessing an element in an array by its index
    //  - Finding the maximum or minimum element in an array
    //  - Checking if a value exists in a sorted array

// AVERAGE CASE- theta(n+1/2)
    // Average case time complexity is O(n) when the algorithm performs a linear amount of time, where n is the input size.
    // Examples:
    //  - Finding the sum of elements in an array
    //  - Sorting an array
    //  - Searching for an element in an unsorted array


// if the loop is nested the n will be multiply(nxn) and when there is the two diffrent loops are there the the n+n will be consider

// SPACE COMPLEXITY  - how many variables are in the code 
    // Space complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm uses, not including the input size.
    // Examples:
    //  - Space complexity of a simple search algorithm is O(1)
    //  - Space complexity of a recursive algorithm is O(n)


 // in worst case the space complexity will be O(n) because in worst case the recursive function call stack will be of n size.
 // in average case the space complexity will be O(1) because in average case the recursive function call stack will be of constant size.
